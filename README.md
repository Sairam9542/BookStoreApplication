The Bookstore Management Application is a Spring Boot-based application designed to simplify the management of bookstore operations by 
enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for id, name, author, price.Using JPA and Spring Boot, the backend is constructed, 
while MySQL serves as the database to manage data persistence. The frontend is handled by Thymeleaf, which offers dynamic, server-side HTML templates.
A MySQL server instance for data storage, Maven for dependency management, and Java version 1.8.0_202 are necessary for this application to work. 
The application's primary entry point is BookstoreApplication.java, which also contains directories for Thymeleaf templates, services, repositories, 
entitiy and REST controllers.
